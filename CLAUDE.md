# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a newly initialized repository for a generative AI use case project. The repository currently contains only a MIT license file and appears to be in the early planning/setup phase.

## Current State

- **License**: MIT License
- **Structure**: Minimal - only LICENSE file present
- **Project Type**: To be determined based on future development

## Development Notes

Since this is a fresh repository with no existing codebase, architecture, or build system:

1. No build commands are currently available
2. No testing framework is set up yet  
3. No linting or formatting tools are configured
4. Project language and framework have not been established

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.
